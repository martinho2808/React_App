From todays work you can start making all of the shareLink weekly assignment.

The add button should contain a modal and the logic to accept and handler user input.
Store the links within the browsers local storage, you will need to json.stringify to store and json.parse when retrieving from the browsers local storage
The search bar should take the users input to the app component. Use that information to filter the links

Links should be passed to the linkedList component
